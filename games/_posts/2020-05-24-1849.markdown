Background
----------
I bought this game in 2014 from the Play Store for HK$38.68 (US$4.99). In a terrible sign for the future of this review series, it seems to have been removed from the store at some point since - and in fact when I try to open it on the tablet, it flashes a warning then crashes!

Gameplay
--------
It's a city-sim game, set during the gold rush in the 1840s, hence the name. There's not much point going into it any further, since you can't install it and it doesn't work anyway...
