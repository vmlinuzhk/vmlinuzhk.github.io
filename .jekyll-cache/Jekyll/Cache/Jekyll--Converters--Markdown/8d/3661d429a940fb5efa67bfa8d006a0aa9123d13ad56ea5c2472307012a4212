I"ô<h1 id="whats-this-all-about-then">Whatâ€™s this all about then?</h1>

<p>Well, in short, Iâ€™ve got some time on my hands, and a tablet (Samsung Tab S5e) with a lot of games on it. Some of them are games I play a lot, some every day, some I used to play but donâ€™t play any more, but a bunch are games Iâ€™ve installed but never really - or actually - played. Iâ€™m going to try to get myself into a habit of reviewing one game per day(ish), in strict alphabetical order, until I get bored.</p>

<p>On the off-chance that Iâ€™m not bored when I run out of games, Iâ€™ve got plenty more available - quite a few on my phone which I donâ€™t have on the tablet, and <em>many</em> more in my Humble Bundle account! But letâ€™s not run before we walk, eh?</p>
