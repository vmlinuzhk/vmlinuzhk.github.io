What's this all about then?
=========

Well, in short, I've got some time on my hands, and a tablet (Samsung Tab S5e) with a lot of games on it. Some of them are games I play a lot, some every day, some I used to play but don't play any more, but a bunch are games I've installed but never really - or actually - played. I'm going to try to get myself into a habit of reviewing one game per day(ish), in strict alphabetical order, until I get bored.

On the off-chance that I'm not bored when I run out of games, I've got plenty more available - quite a few on my phone which I don't have on the tablet, and __many__ more in my Humble Bundle account! But let's not run before we walk, eh?
